The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive financial management application, progressing from initial requirements to a feature-rich MVP. Key phases included: building the core full-stack application (FastAPI, React, MongoDB) with financial tracking and Excel export; enhancing the Dashboard with dynamic filters and recurring expense analysis; implementing a robust user authentication system (JWT, multi-tenant); and developing a landing page with Hotmart integration for monetization, adjusting pricing based on user feedback. The AI also addressed critical bugs related to data display and UI rendering. The trajectory concludes with a major architectural refactoring request from the user, emphasizing modularity, Dockerization, PEP 8, clean code, and Pytest. The AI has acknowledged this and is about to start by creating a new Git branch.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an automated, professional Excel spreadsheet for personal/business financial control, focused on revenues, expenses, and monthly results. It must be visually appealing, intuitive, and sellable. Key tabs include: Dashboard (charts, indicators, date filters, recurring expenses), Revenues, Expenses, Categories, Monthly Summary (dynamic table, projections), and Financial Projections. Functionalities: automatic updates, protected formulas, clear input fields, modern design, Excel/Google Sheets compatibility, optional macros. The AI also built a full-stack web application mirroring these features. Monetization involves a SaaS model with individual user accounts, Hotmart payment integration, a sales landing page, and flexible pricing (monthly, semi-annual, annual). The current work aims to refactor the backend for better architecture, add Dockerization, and implement comprehensive testing.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB,  (password hashing), JWT (authentication),  (Excel generation).
- **Frontend**: React.js, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, .
- **Deployment**: Supervisor, Railway, Docker/Docker Compose (pending).
- **Architecture**: Full-stack web app, RESTful APIs, Multi-tenant, Hotmart webhook integration.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a full-stack web application with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend, utilizing MongoDB for data persistence.

**Current Directory Structure (after initial build and before latest refactor request):**


-   : This file currently contains the entire FastAPI backend logic. It manages MongoDB connections, defines data models (User, Categoria, Receita, Despesa, Assinatura), handles user authentication with JWT, provides all API endpoints for financial data management (CRUD), dashboard analytics, projections, Excel export, and Hotmart webhook integration. All data-related endpoints are protected and filter data by . This file will be refactored into a modular structure as per the latest request.
-   : A shell script created to aid deployment on platforms like Railway, defining how the backend service should be started.
-   : The main entry point for the React application. It configures client-side routing using , integrates the  for global authentication state, and uses  to secure routes that require user login.
-   : Manages user authentication state, providing login, logout, and token management functionalities across the frontend.
-   : These files define the various user interface pages:
    -   : Displays financial overviews, charts, date filters, and recurring expenses. Includes conditional rendering for messages when no data is present.
    -   , , : Forms and tables for managing individual financial records and categories.
    -   , : Present aggregated financial summaries and future projections, also with friendly messages for no data.
    -   , : User interface for creating new accounts and logging in.
    -   : The public-facing sales page for the product, outlining features and pricing plans.
    -   : Page for selecting subscription plans and initiating the payment process via Hotmart.
-    and : Documentation files detailing the steps for integrating with Hotmart and deploying the application, respectively.

The current architecture is functional but is now slated for a major refactoring to improve modularity and maintainability, including containerization.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer had just completed a significant phase of development. The application is a fully functional full-stack web app, built with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend, using MongoDB.

It includes:
1.  **Core Financial Features**: Functionality to manage  (Revenues),  (Expenses), and  (Categories).
2.  **Dashboard**: A dynamic dashboard with charts, key indicators, date filtering capabilities (Total Time, Last Month, Last 6 Months, Custom Range), and a section for  (Recurring Expenses).
3.  **Reporting**:  (Monthly Summary) and  (Financial Projections) pages.
4.  **Excel Export**: The ability to export all financial data into a professional Excel spreadsheet.
5.  **User Authentication**: A complete system including user registration, login with JWT tokens, protected routes, and multi-tenant data isolation (each user only sees their own data).
6.  **Monetization Setup**: A  and  in the frontend, along with backend endpoints for  (Subscriptions) and a  endpoint for payment integration. The pricing structure has been updated to reflect monthly (R4.90), semi-annual (R9.90/month), and annual (R6.90/month) plans.
7.  **Deployment Support**: A  script and detailed Hotmart publication guides (, ).

All previously reported bugs related to the Projeções page (missing  field for new users) and a syntax error in  have been identified and resolved, ensuring the frontend compiles successfully and displays friendly messages when no data is available.

The last interaction was the user providing a detailed request to perform a major backend refactoring, including modularization, Dockerization, adherence to PEP 8 and clean code, and extensive ============================= test session starts ==============================
